# spam-detection
Machine Learning project for classifying spam emails
# ðŸ“§ Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using classic supervised learning algorithms.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains text data of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam". Text preprocessing steps such as:
- Lowercasing
- Removing punctuation and stop words
- TF-IDF vectorization

were applied to prepare the features.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
After evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score, the models achieved high accuracy, with Naive Bayes performing best on this specific dataset.

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- Importance of text preprocessing in NLP problems
- TF-IDF improves model accuracy over raw text features
- Naive Bayes is a strong baseline for spam classification
